          <p style="margin-top:8px;">
            I think, for most designers, one of the biggest challenges in their profession is to create a personal portfolio. I'm also one of those lucky ones. So let me speak about that process but with short answers-questions instead of very long paragraphs. </p>
          <p>
            Ready? Let's start!
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <div class="subtitle-frame">
            <span>1-What was the first stage of this process? </span>
          </div>
          <p>
            The first thing I did is trying to read all writings about portfolios to be inspired and to see what other people think, or what are their expectations.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <div class="subtitle-frame">
            <span>2-Looking at other designers' portfolios? </span>
          </div>
          <p>
            After the reading part, I can say that I searched for portfolios from all over the world to see what is done in practice. Whether it's a visual designer, illustrator, or UX designer.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <div class="subtitle-frame">
            <span>3-What did I want for the UI?</span>
          </div>
          <p>
            When it comes to designing, a simple, comprehensible, and clear interface was always my first choice. I didn't want it to be an over-designed and experimental portfolio.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <div class="subtitle-frame">
            <span>4-Why didn't I want it to be over-designed?</span>
          </div>
          <p>
            Making a site that is easy to navigate is my priority. I don't want the viewer to feel lost and unable to see all of my content.
          </p>

        <div class="section">
          <div class="subtitle-frame">
            <span>5-What did I focus on when I was creating the case studies?</span>
          </div>
          <p>
            When it's come to case studies, for sure, it should be a very long answer üòÑ. Almost every portfolio I saw has the same titles. User flows, personas, wireframe, prototype, and going on like this.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's maybe okay for most people. But for me, the real problem here is that it looks like small disconnected parts that are pieced together as a whole. When I was working on case studies, I really attached importance to tell the process in a way that
            we might call it a story. I just focused on the context that reveals the most interesting and impactful parts of the project.
          </p>

        <div class="section">
          <div class="subtitle-frame">
            <span>6-Did I develop the portfolio all by myself?</span>
          </div>
          <p>
            I‚Äôve always wanted my portfolio to be really personal, so I decided to produce it entirely alone. I was lucky to have the chance to do a bit of development, so I had enough to start building a static page and coded this portfolio from scratch. Thanks
            to my college for coding experience. ‚å®Ô∏è

        <div class="section">
          <div class="subtitle-frame">
            <span>7-How long did it take to create a portfolio for me?</span>
          </div>
          <p>
            After graduation from college, I wanted to start the portfolio process, but because of some health problems in my family, I couldn't focus on designing my portfolio during that time. So that in the beginning, the process was already postponed by about
            3 or 4 months. And from where I stand, this was a great loss of time also the best time to rest right after school. Two opposite feelings at the same time. To cut a long story short, If we include the redesigning chapter, it took me probably
            almost a year to get it done.
          </p>

        <div class="section">
          <div class="subtitle-frame">
            <span>8-Things to remember when I was building my portfolio?</span>
          </div>
          <div class="list">
            <ul>

              <li>Quality is not quantity</li>
              <li>Be enough and clear for yourself</li>
              <li>Simple to use</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <div class="subtitle-frame">
            <span>9-What didn't go well?</span>
          </div>
          <p>
            Somehow, regardless of how much I try, my inner complaint ended up in a loop of chasing for excellence. So I focused on imperfections and had some trouble seeing anything else. That was something I tried to deal with it and caused me a waste of time.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <div class="subtitle-frame">
            <span>10-What did work well?</span>
          </div>
          <p>
            I think the simplicity of this portfolio is meeting my expectations of what I wanted since the very beginning. I hope it didn't end up looking very polished and stereotyped.
