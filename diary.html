            Nearly three or four years ago, <b>I've created an Instagram account to get inspiration from people who have been learning to code and sharing their journey</b>. Every day, they were writing what they're doing. It made me inspired to see them
            trying to learn something.
          </p>
          <p>When I created an Instagram account, it wasn't easy to find people who share their design or programming journey. After lots of research, found people. ðŸ˜® But people weren't just sharing their journey also posting some personal life stuff too.
            To be honest,<b> I didn't care about their personal life, those posts were just a distraction for me.</b>

            When the idea of this projects surprisingly got fallen from heaven to my mind, the question was there:
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>  What would it be like if there is an online diary for people to share their design and coding journey every day?</b> Not the other stuff, just diary for design and coding.

            After the idea hit me, I tried to reach people who have been sharing their journey through digital channels to understand:

          <div class="list">

          <p>
            <b> I conducted interviews with 5 people</b> and asked these questions:

          <p>
            Also<b> interviewed with another 3 people who follow these learning stories</b> to find out:

            Asked these questions:

          <p>This research uncovered something interesting for me. <b>Unlike my foresight, people's first aim was tracking the process instead of getting more followers.</b> I wasn't expecting that.
          </p>
          <p>
            After when they answered what are their reasons to share, I asked them to rank their answers according to its importance. Based on all the people's results, "tracking the process" took the first place.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following answers are their top 3 reasons for what motivates them to keep sharing all the process.

            </div>
            <p> I sorted stories by date because I thought of the project as an online diary. I didn't put any other choice on the table.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, I<b> put all the stories under two main titles:</b>

            </div>

            <p>
              While doing this, I aimed to filter stories according to their content and thus making it easy for users. (In fact, in the first version of the project, I'd divided stories into two categories; designers and developers. But after realizing that these
              two titles cause confusion, I changed it to design and programming.) </p>

              We all know that the primary purpose of this project is to share stories, so I wanted this option to be <b>easily accessible when users want to add a new story.</b> And I decided to put it in the sidebar as a navigation link. (not like a

            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore I added the "Discover" page to the project, which will make it easier to find different people and projects. And on this page, there're two categories; designers and developers. </p>
