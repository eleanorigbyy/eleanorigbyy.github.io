            In the last year of my university life, I had to do a thesis. I wanted to work on a project that I can be more familiar with all UX design processes. After I had kept a balance between my expectations and the requests of the department with my advisor,
            we started the project process. To determine the idea of the project, we focused on the problems we witnessed in our daily life and tried to do some observations.

          <p>
            In my country, Turkey, neighborhoods used to be places where people socialized and discussed their daily happenings. But <b>now this tradition seems to have disappeared in big cities for a broad age range. People who live in the same building, street, or
            neighborhood don’t even know each other, and this situation has some challenges.</b> </p>

          <p>
            So <b>my mission was to help individuals in order to strengthen communication between their neighbors</b> and make them informed with all neighborhood happenings.

            To get to know people, how they live, what they do, and how they interact with each other, I started user research with a series of interviews.
          </p>
          <p>
            At first, <b>I reached out to 30 people of all ages between 20-75 to determine the age range of the project. </b>I wanted to learn how strong and effective their relationship with the people living in the same apartment or street.

          <p>
            I observed that the people in their 40s or older have communication with their neighbors and they still attach great importance to the sense of neighborliness. 30 % of all the people aged between 20-40 think in a more individual way like "why I have to
            keep in touch with people just because they're living in my apartment?", while the other 70% of them want to communicate with neighbors but don't make an effort for that.
          </p>

          <p>
            Based on all that observation, I didn't identify the people in their 40s and older as a part of target users since all of them already communicate somehow. <b>The age range of target users was between 20-40.</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            Then, by taking advantage of these results, I first started to research the population age groups of Sakarya( where I lived at that time) to determine which district we should choose for this project. <b>My goal was to find the district with the highest
            proportion of young population (aged between 20-40) to the total population.</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            The total population of Sakarya province was 990,214 in 2017. People aged between 20-40 made up 31% of the total population. After, I looked into the proportion of people aged between 20-40 to the total district population for every district in Sakarya.
            Serdivan was ranked first with 36.6% among districts in Sakarya. With that rate, I found out that Serdivan is the right place for the project.

            After I had decided on choosing Serdivan as the right place for the project, <b> I conducted interviews with 10 people aged between 20-40 to learn about the problems and the experiences they had during the time they spent there.</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            It was really necessary to identify the users to understand who it is I was designing for. All of them had requests and problems about their neighborhoods according to their lifestyle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Going from there, research revealed distinct needs for two groups:

            Getting more deeper into the people's issues, I decided on a solution for what features the project will have. After that, I started to design the flow for general and specific use cases to think about how users arrive at the website and where they’ll
            go next.

            <p>
              But, as a negative point, improving the user registration process for users' security and privacy is an important thing in the project to consider for the future.

            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, it made sense to think that it was necessary to add three pages below into this project.

            </div>


            <p>
              With the for sale page, users can buy or sell items but can’t take payments through the app, they can just contact the seller through messages for details like price, etc. Also for the recommendations page, there're 4 subcategories: cafe, shop, hospital,
              and pharmacy.

              While researching Serdivan Municipality's services, I saw that there is a veterinary service for stray animals. </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              After notifications sent by phone, petition, or e-mail, collecting stray animals, transporting them to the rehabilitation center, neutering, and vaccinating then taking them back where they were collected is what they're doing during the process. </p>

            <p>
              Using this application to connect with people would be easier for municipal employees since there would be no multiple notifications channels like e-mail, phone to follow. So I included this veterinary service into the project along with <b> other public
              servants like police to connect with citizens more closely and directly.</b>

            <p>
              So to check and share security alerts, lost pets, and items quickly, there should be a page for these kinds of issues in the project. Because <b>security problems are one of the topics that they're talking about during the interviews.</b>

            When<b> studying information systems engineering but want to switch to a design career,</b> this project was a great opportunity for me to be able to see the design processes within six months. </p>

          <p>
            It was too easy for me to<b> get caught in the trap of focusing on “making it beautiful”</b> without attaching importance to the actual purpose of the design. But just because something is useful doesn't make it beautiful and just because
            something looks good doesn't mean it's useful. So I hope I've kept a balance between both sides.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, despite all the things I did, of course, there were some parts that I didn't do such as usability testing from early development until the last part. In the end, the learning process is still going on for me. </p>
